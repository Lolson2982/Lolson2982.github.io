  <para> HI everyone, and welcome to my about tab. <br>

  	My name is Lars Olson and I am a junior majoring in finance at the University of Rhode Island. <br> 

  	I am taking this class because I am looking to minor in computer programming. Because alot of finance positions use financial software analytics, I want to be able to understand the code and maybe be able to edit it myself.
