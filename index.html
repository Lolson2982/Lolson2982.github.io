  <h1> Welcome Everyone!!! </h1>
  <p> HI everyone, and welcome to my website. I am excited to start learning to program.
    <br> This past summer, I started to learn how to code in html by watching videos through youtube. 
    <br> Hopefully this class will teach me more about coding and how to code in other, more advanced languages. 
  </p>

  <p> This website will be the foundation of my coding education. First we started with learning HTML, currently we are learning CSS, and next week we will start on learning the javascript programming language 
  </p>
