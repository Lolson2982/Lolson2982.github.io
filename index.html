  <h1> Welcome Everyone!!! </h1>
  <p> HI everyone, and welcome to my website. I am excited to start learning to program.
    <br> This past summer, I started to learn how to code in html by watching videos through youtube. 
    <br> Hopefully this class will teach me more about coding and how to code in other, more advanced languages. 
  </p>
